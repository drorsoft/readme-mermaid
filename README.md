# Integration with GitHub README Files

This guide explains how to integrate Mermaid diagrams into your GitHub `README.md` files. Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

## How to Use Mermaid in GitHub README

To include Mermaid diagrams in your GitHub `README.md` file, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Fenced Code Block**: Use triple backticks to create a fenced code block.
2. **Specify the Language**: Indicate `mermaid` as the language for the code block.
3. **Write Mermaid Code**: Inside the fenced code block, write your Mermaid diagram code.

### Example

Here is an example of how to include a simple Mermaid diagram in your `README.md` file:

```markdown
# Example Mermaid Diagram

This is an example of a Mermaid diagram in a GitHub README file.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
 
Result:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

### Explanation

- `graph TD;` specifies a top-down graph.
- `A-->B;` creates a link from node A to node B.
- `A-->C;` creates a link from node A to node C.
- `B-->D;` creates a link from node B to node D.
- `C-->D;` creates a link from node C to node D.
