# Integration with GitHub README Files

This guide explains how to integrate Mermaid diagrams into your GitHub `README.md` files. Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.



## How to Use Mermaid in GitHub README

To include Mermaid diagrams in your GitHub `README.md` file, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Fenced Code Block**: Use triple backticks to create a fenced code block.
2. **Specify the Language**: Indicate `mermaid` as the language for the code block.
3. **Write Mermaid Code**: Inside the fenced code block, write your Mermaid diagram code.

### Example

Here is an example of how to include a simple Mermaid diagram in your `README.md` file:

```markdown
# Example Mermaid Diagram

This is an example of a Mermaid diagram in a GitHub README file.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
 
Result:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

### Explanation

- `graph TD;` specifies a top-down graph.
- `A-->B;` creates a link from node A to node B.
- `A-->C;` creates a link from node A to node C.
- `B-->D;` creates a link from node B to node D.
- `C-->D;` creates a link from node C to node D.

## Sequence Diagrams

You can also create sequence diagrams using Mermaid. Here is an example:

```markdown
    
# Example Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Alice
participant Bob
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
loop HealthCheck
John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
John-->>Alice: Great!
John->>Bob: How about you?
Bob-->>John: Jolly good!

```
 

Result:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Alice
participant Bob
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
loop HealthCheck
John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
John-->>Alice: Great!
John->>Bob: How about you?
Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

### State Diagrams

```mermaid
---
title: Simple sample
---
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]

    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
```

## Advanced examples

### User Journey Diagram

```mermaid
journey
    title My working day
    section Go to work
        Make tea: 5: Me
        Go upstairs: 3: Me
        Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
        Go downstairs: 5: Me
        Sit down: 5: Me
```

### Pie Chart

```mermaid
pie title Pets adopted by volunteers
    "Dogs" : 386
    "Cats" : 85
    "Rats" : 15
```
